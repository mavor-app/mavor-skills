## Purpose
Applies market basket analysis to your order history to surface product pairs that customers naturally buy together. For every co-purchased pair it calculates **support** (how often the pair appears), **confidence** (given product A, how likely is B?), and **lift** (how much more likely than chance). The output is actionable input for product bundles, "frequently bought together" widgets, cross-sell email flows, and homepage recommendations. Read-only — no mutations are executed.

## Prerequisites

- A Shopify store connection is selected in Mavor (connectionId is injected by the runtime).
- Do not ask for API keys, tokens, or the `store` domain parameter.
- Use `shopify_graphql_query` with the GraphQL documents below unless a dedicated Shopify tool applies.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| store | string | yes | — | Store domain (e.g., mystore.myshopify.com) |
| format | string | no | human | Output format: `human` or `json` |
| dry_run | bool | no | false | Preview operations without executing mutations |
| date_range_start | string | yes | — | Start date in ISO 8601 (e.g., `2025-01-01`) |
| date_range_end | string | yes | — | End date in ISO 8601 (e.g., `2025-03-31`) |
| min_support | integer | no | 5 | Minimum number of orders a pair must co-appear in to be included |
| min_confidence | float | no | 0.1 | Minimum P(B\|A) threshold (0–1) |
| min_lift | float | no | 1.0 | Only include pairs where lift > this value (> 1 means non-random) |
| top_n | integer | no | 20 | Number of top pairs to show in the ranked output |
| sort_by | string | no | lift | Ranking metric: `lift`, `confidence`, or `support` |
| exclude_tags | string | no | — | Comma-separated product tags to exclude (e.g., `gift-wrap,donation`) |

## Workflow Steps

1. **OPERATION:** `orders` — query
   **Inputs:** `first: 250`, `query: "created_at:>='<date_range_start>' created_at:<='<date_range_end>'"`, pagination cursor; select `lineItems` with `product { id, title }` and `quantity`; skip orders with a single line item
   **Expected output:** All multi-item orders in range; paginate until `hasNextPage: false`; build a product frequency map (`product_id → order_count`) and a pair frequency map (`(product_a_id, product_b_id) → co_occurrence_count`)

2. **In-memory analysis:**
   - For each order with ≥ 2 distinct products, enumerate every unique unordered pair and increment the pair counter
   - Compute metrics for each pair that meets `min_support`:
     - **Support** = `pair_count / total_orders`
     - **Confidence A→B** = `pair_count / count(orders containing A)`
     - **Confidence B→A** = `pair_count / count(orders containing B)`
     - **Lift** = `support / (P(A) × P(B))`
   - Filter by `min_confidence` and `min_lift`; sort by `sort_by`; truncate to `top_n`

## GraphQL Operations

```graphql
# orders:query (multi-item basket analysis) — validated against api_version 2025-01
query OrdersForAffinityAnalysis($first: Int!, $after: String, $query: String) {
  orders(first: $first, after: $after, query: $query) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        createdAt
        lineItems(first: 50) {
          edges {
            node {
              quantity
              product {
                id
                title
                tags
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor
    }
  }
}
```

## Output Format
CSV file `product_affinity_<YYYY-MM-DD>.csv` with one row per qualifying pair:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `rank` | Position in sorted output |
| `product_a_id` | Shopify product GID for the first item |
| `product_a_title` | Product A name |
| `product_b_id` | Shopify product GID for the second item |
| `product_b_title` | Product B name |
| `co_occurrence_count` | Number of orders containing both products |
| `support` | `co_occurrence_count / total_orders` |
| `confidence_a_to_b` | P(B\|A) — likelihood of B given A is in cart |
| `confidence_b_to_a` | P(A\|B) — likelihood of A given B is in cart |
| `lift` | How much more likely than random co-occurrence |
| `recommendation_type` | `bundle_candidate` if lift > 2, else `cross_sell` |

## Error Handling
| Error | Cause | Recovery |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `THROTTLED` | API rate limit from paginating large order history | Wait 2 s, retry up to 3 times; narrow date range if persistent |
| `product` is null on line item | Product was deleted after purchase | Skip that item from pair analysis; count the order in the total |
| Zero pairs above threshold | Store has few multi-item orders or thresholds too strict | Lower `min_support` to 2 and `min_confidence` to 0.05, or widen date range |
| Combinatorial explosion | Stores with very large line item counts per order | The pair-enumeration loop skips orders with > 20 distinct products to cap O(n²) growth |

## Best Practices
1. Use at least 90 days of order history — short windows produce noisy lift scores because the probability denominators are small.
2. **Lift > 2** is a strong bundle signal: customers are buying these products together at least twice as often as chance would predict.
3. **Confidence A→B > 30%** makes for a reliable "frequently bought with" widget: three in ten shoppers who buy A also buy B.
4. Filter out accessories and add-ons (like gift wrap or donation SKUs) with `exclude_tags` before ranking — they inflate support scores without being meaningful cross-sell pairs.
5. Use the `recommendation_type` column to split your output: `bundle_candidate` pairs are best for pre-built bundles or volume discounts; `cross_sell` pairs are better suited to cart upsells and post-purchase email recommendations.
6. Re-run quarterly — seasonal products enter and exit the top pairs list, and ignoring that produces stale recommendations.
